Encryption and Decryption using Python

This Python script demonstrates a basic encryption and decryption technique using a custom substitution cipher. The script generates a random key by shuffling a combination of punctuation, digits, and ASCII letters.

Encryption:
To encrypt a message, the script prompts the user to enter plain text. Each character of the input message is replaced with its corresponding character in the randomly generated key. The resulting ciphertext is then displayed.

Decryption:
For decryption, the user is prompted to input the ciphertext. The script then reverses the encryption process by mapping each character in the ciphertext back to its original character in the key. The decrypted plaintext is then printed.

This script serves as a simple illustration of how encryption and decryption can be implemented using Python. While the custom substitution cipher used here is not suitable for secure communication, it provides a basic understanding of the concepts involved.
